# Work Day Scheduler

In this week on this odd number project we were provided with the starter code to begin our weekly challenge. The HTML elements were set up with classes that corresponded to the CSS selectors that were provided in the starter code. In the JavaScript file you will find simple yet functional code that serves its purpose. The present day of the week together with the present date will be displayed on top of the page everytime the page is loaded. On this daily standard schedule the user will find that the time blocks will be color coded (e.g. past-gray, present-red, and future-gray). When a task is entered into the text area, the user may save it by clicking on the save button, and the task will be stored in localStorage. When the user refreshes the page the tasks will persist in their corresponding time blocks.

## Purpose
